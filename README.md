## Overview
**libvsensors** is a generic Sensors Management Library, including CPU, Memory, Network, SMC,
initially written for OSX (10.11.6).

## System requirements
- A somewhat capable compiler (gcc/clang), make (GNU,BSD), sh (sh/bash/ksh)
  and coreutils (awk,grep,sed,date,touch,head,printf,which,find,test,...)

This is not an exhaustive list but the list of systems on which it has been built:
- Linux: slitaz 4 2.6.37, ubuntu 12.04 3.11.0
- OSX 10.11.6
- OpenBSD 5.5
- FreeBSD 11.1

## Compilation
Just type:
    $ make

If the Makefile cannot be parsed by 'make', try:
    $ ./make-fallback

Most of utilities used in Makefile are defined in variables and can be changed
with something like 'make SED=gsed TAR=gnutar' (or ./make-fallback SED=...)

To See how make understood the Makefile, you can type:
    $ make info # ( or ./make-fallback info)
